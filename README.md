Youtube Downloader For Volt Vision

It works but im not sure how to host it for the class only, if you are a future volt vision class feel free to attempt to figure out.

Its a super basic nodeJS site that uses ytdl library to download, you can also add option to select mp4 or mp3, i never got around to it.
